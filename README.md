# Add to Cart Application

This project is a simple **React.js** application that demonstrates an e-commerce "Add to Cart" functionality. It uses **React Router** for navigation and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. The app fetches product data from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com) and allows users to manage their cart with features like adding/removing items, updating quantities, and calculating totals.
